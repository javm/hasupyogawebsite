# Generating ssl certificate
mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl
cd /etc/nginx/ssl

Then generate a new self signed SSL certificate with the openssl command below:

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/hasupyoga.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/hasupyoga.crt

Fill in the requested info. The SSL certificate file has been generated, now change the permissions of the private key file "hasupyoga.key" to 600:

chmod 600 hasupyoga.key

# MySQL in dreamhost
database: hasupyogadb

user: hasupyoga
passwd:   pfYvd7PNmSXj
